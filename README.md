## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my QA training and focuses on analyzing server logs and performing SQL queries for a **taxi application**.  
The goal was to practice investigating **backend log data**, identify **IPs** and **error patterns**, and validate **fleet and ride data** directly in the **PostgreSQL** database to support the backend QA process.  
All queries and log extractions were documented to ensure clear communication with the development team.

## 🎯 Project Goal

- Analyze server logs to identify IP addresses and error events (400/500)
- Validate fleet, companies, and ride details in the **chicago_taxi** database
- Produce clear evidence to support backend debugging and QA

---

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

- **Terminal (Bash)** — log filtering and processing
- **PostgreSQL** — database queries and validation
- **Google Docs** — documentation of results

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Connect to the server using the console  
2. Run **Bash** commands to filter and organize log files  
3. Execute **SQL** queries on the **chicago_taxi** database  
4. Document findings and evidence in **Google Docs**

---

## 🧾 Results

- Bash commands created for log filtering and extraction  
- IP addresses and HTTP 400/500 error records identified  
- SQL queries validated fleet, company, and weather condition data  
- Evidence compiled and shared through Google Docs

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- Filtering and analyzing logs in the terminal  
- Writing SQL queries with joins and conditions  
- Producing clear documentation to support backend QA activities

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Automate log collection and filtering routines  
- Integrate query scripts with automated reporting tools
